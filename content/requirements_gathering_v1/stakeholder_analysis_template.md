## Measuring Stakeholder Engagement

### Key Indicators

- **Response Rate**: % responding to requests for information/feedback
- **Quality of Input**: Depth and relevance of stakeholder contributions
- **Decision Speed**: Time to make decisions and approve recommendations

### Engagement Improvement Strategies
- **Low Attendance**: Adjust meeting times, reduce frequency, improve relevance
- **Poor Response**: Simplify requests, set clear deadlines, explain importance
- **Superficial Input**: Ask better questions, provide more context, schedule 1:1s
- **Slow Decisions**: Clarify decision criteria, identify blockers, escalate appropriately

Remember: Effective stakeholder management is about building relationships, managing expectations, and facilitating clear communication. Every stakeholder interaction is an opportunity to build trust and move the project forward.
