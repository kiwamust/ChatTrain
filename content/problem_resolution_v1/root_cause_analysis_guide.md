# Systematic Root Cause Analysis for IT Systems

## Introduction to Root Cause Analysis

### Definition and Purpose
Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a systematic process for identifying the underlying causes of problems or failures, not just their symptoms. The goal is to understand what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent it from happening again.

**Key Principles:**
- Focus on causes, not blame
- Look beyond immediate symptoms
- Use data and evidence, not assumptions
- Consider both technical and human factors
- Develop sustainable prevention strategies

### The Difference Between Symptoms and Root Causes

**Symptoms:**
- What you observe happening
- The visible effects of problems
- Often multiple symptoms from one cause
- Tend to recur if root cause isn't addressed

**Root Causes:**
- The fundamental reason why the problem occurred
- Often hidden or not immediately obvious
- Addressing them prevents recurrence
- May require systemic changes

**Example:**
- **Symptom:** System crashed during peak usage
- **Immediate Cause:** Server ran out of memory
- **Root Cause:** No capacity planning process for growth

## The TRACE Methodology

### T - Timeline Construction
**Objective:** Create accurate sequence of events

**Steps:**
1. **Identify the Failure Point**
   - When was the problem first noticed?
   - When did it actually start?
   - What was the triggering event?

2. **Map the Event Sequence**
   - What happened immediately before?
   - What was happening in parallel?
   - What changed recently?

3. **Gather Timeline Data**
   - System logs and timestamps
   - User activity reports
   - Change management records
   - Monitoring alerts

**Timeline Template:**
```
Time    | Event                     | Source        | Impact
--------|---------------------------|---------------|--------
09:00   | Scheduled deployment      | Change Log    | None
09:15   | Configuration update      | System Log    | None
09:30   | Traffic spike begins      | Monitoring    | Minor
09:45   | Response time increases   | APM          | Moderate
10:00   | Error rate spikes         | Error Log     | High
10:05   | System becomes unusable   | User Reports  | Critical
```

## Advanced Analysis Techniques

### The 5 Whys Method
**Application Steps:**
1. State the problem clearly
2. Ask "Why did this happen?"
3. For each answer, ask "Why?" again
4. Continue until you reach a root cause
5. Validate the cause-effect relationships

**Example Analysis:**
```
Problem: Production system crashed during peak hours

Why #1: Why did the system crash?
Answer: The database ran out of connections

Why #2: Why did the database run out of connections?
Answer: The connection pool was too small

Why #3: Why was the connection pool too small?
Answer: It was configured for average load, not peak load

Why #4: Why wasn't it configured for peak load?
Answer: Load testing didn't include realistic peak scenarios

Why #5: Why didn't load testing include realistic peaks?
Answer: Requirements didn't specify peak load characteristics

Root Cause: Inadequate requirements gathering for performance characteristics
