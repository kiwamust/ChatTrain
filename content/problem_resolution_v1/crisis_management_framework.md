### Advanced Problem-Solving Techniques

#### 5 Whys Analysis
**Example Application:**
1. **Why did the system fail?** Database connection timeout
2. **Why did the database timeout?** Too many concurrent connections
3. **Why were there too many connections?** Connection pooling not configured properly
4. **Why wasn't connection pooling configured?** Not included in deployment checklist
5. **Why wasn't it in the checklist?** Process review didn't include scalability considerations

**Result:** Root cause is insufficient process review, not just technical configuration
