# Overcoming Resistance to Technology Change

## Understanding Resistance

### Why People Resist Change
Resistance is a natural human response to perceived threats or uncertainty. Understanding the root causes helps address them effectively.

**Core Fears:**
- **Loss of Control:** "I won't be able to do my job the way I know how"
- **Incompetence:** "I might not be good at this new way"
- **Irrelevance:** "Maybe I won't be needed anymore"
- **Overwork:** "This is just more work on top of what I already do"
- **Failure:** "What if this doesn't work and we've wasted time/money?"

**Past Experiences:**
- Previous failed technology implementations
- Inadequate training on past systems
- Promises that weren't kept
- Increased workload from previous changes
- Lack of support during transitions
