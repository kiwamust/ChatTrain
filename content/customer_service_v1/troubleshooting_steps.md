## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### Password Reset Process

#### Step 1: Verify Customer Identity
```
- Ask for username OR email address
- Confirm account exists in system
- Verify this is the account owner
```

#### Step 2: Initiate Password Reset
```
1. Click "Send Password Reset" in admin panel
2. Confirm email address with customer
3. Inform customer: "I've sent a reset link to [email]"
4. Set expectation: "You should receive it within 2-5 minutes"
```

#### Step 3: Guide Customer Through Process
```
What to tell the customer:
- "Check your email for a message from [company]"
- "The subject line will be 'Password Reset Request'"
- "Click the link in the email to set a new password"
- "The link will expire in 24 hours"
```

#### Step 4: Handle Common Issues

**Customer can't find email:**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify email address spelling
- Resend if needed
- Offer phone verification as alternative

**Customer clicks link but gets error:**
- Link may have expired (24-hour limit)
- Generate new reset link
- Guide through process again

**Customer wants to set password over phone:**
- Explain security policy (passwords not shared verbally)
- Emphasize reset email is secure method
- Offer to stay on line while they complete process

### Username Issues

#### Common Username Problems:
1. **Extra spaces** - "john.smith " vs "john.smith"
2. **Wrong case** - "John.Smith" vs "john.smith"
3. **Forgotten format** - Email vs username
4. **Special characters** - Underscore vs period

#### Troubleshooting Steps:
```
1. Ask customer to spell username slowly
2. Try common variations:
   - With/without spaces
   - Different capitalization
   - Email address instead of username
3. Check if account exists under slightly different spelling
4. If still not found, offer to create new account
```

### Account Lockout Scenarios

#### Temporary Lockout (15 minutes)
- **Cause**: 3 failed login attempts
- **Action**: Wait 15 minutes OR reset password
- **Script**: "Your account is temporarily locked for security. We can either wait 15 minutes or I can send you a password reset link right now."

#### Extended Lockout (Manual unlock required)
- **Cause**: 5+ failed attempts or suspicious activity
- **Action**: Manual unlock by support team
- **Script**: "I'll unlock your account right now and send you a password reset link to ensure you can get back in safely."

### Email Delivery Issues

#### Primary Troubleshooting:
1. **Check spam/junk folder**
   - "Can you check your spam or junk mail folder?"
   - "Sometimes email filters catch password reset emails"

2. **Verify email address**
   - "Let me confirm the email address: [spell it out]"
   - "Is that the correct email address?"

3. **Try different email**
   - "Do you have an alternative email address we can try?"
   - "Sometimes work email servers block external emails"

4. **Check email server status**
   - "Are you receiving other emails normally today?"
   - "There might be a delay with your email provider"

#### Alternative Solutions:
- Phone verification (if customer has phone on file)
- Security questions (if configured)
- Escalate to supervisor for manual verification

### Browser & Technical Issues

#### Basic Browser Troubleshooting:
```
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Try incognito/private browsing mode
3. Try different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
4. Disable browser extensions temporarily
5. Check if JavaScript is enabled
```

#### When to Suggest Browser Changes:
- Customer using very old browser version
- Known compatibility issues
- Customer reports page not loading correctly

### System Status Issues

#### Before Troubleshooting Individual Issues:
1. **Check system status dashboard**
2. **Review current incident reports**
3. **Verify if issue is widespread**

#### If System is Down:
- "I can see we're experiencing some technical difficulties right now"
- "Our technical team is working on it and we expect it to be resolved within [timeframe]"
- "I'll make sure to follow up with you once it's fixed"
- "Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?"
